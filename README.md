Title: Ultrasound Image Pregnancy Analyzer


Team members:
Andrew Ferrer (alf108), Andy Huang (ahuang213)

Project decription:

The goal of our project is to develop a neural network that is trained to determine if a women is pregnant based off ultrasound images. The data set that will be used for this project will be ultrasound images taken of women who are pregnant, as well as ultrasound images of women who are not pregnant. This dataset will be taken from **https://zenodo.org/record/3904280**, which contains images separated by anatomical plane as well as by machine used to capture the image. A long term goal of the project is to develop the neural network to also determine the stage of the pregnancy based off of the ultrasound images.
