Project decription

The goal of our project is to develop a neural network that is able to be trained to determine if a women is pregnant based off ultrasound images. The data set used for this project will be ultrasound images taken of women who are pregnant, as well as ultrasound images of women who are not pregnant. A long term goal of the project is to develop the neural network to also determine how long a women has bee pregnant for based off of the ultrasound images.
